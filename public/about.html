<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    Hi! My name is Tenzin and I am a web developer. Welcome to my portfolio! 
    I am a current CS student with a passion for all things to do with technology.
    This is my first official portfolio, which is super exciting.

    I was born in India but moved to NYC when I was 5. 
    I ended up attending Boston University but as a pre med student.
    I have always dabbled with programming but never had official schooling,
    so I decided to go back to university to get a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.
    This project marks the beginning of my journey in tech.
